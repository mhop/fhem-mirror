<H1>USB compendium</H1>

Several fhem users are plagued by spontaneous disconnects/reconnects of USB
devices. This is not an issue of fhem but a problem of hardware and/or USB
drivers.<P>

This document summarizes some findings on the issue. They are taken from
users' experience and from a web research. This USB compendium is written for Linux
users.



<H2>A. Problem description</H2>


USB devices spontaneously disconnect from the bus. They are reconnected after
some time ranging from zero to many seconds. fhem global log shows messages like

<pre>
2009.01.12 19:22:14 1: USB device /dev/elv_fhz1300pc disconnected, waiting to reappear
2009.01.12 19:22:19 1: USB device /dev/elv_fhz1300pc reappeared
</pre>

A look into the kernel message log with
<pre>
grep usb /var/log/messages | tail -n 100 | less
</pre>

shows messages like

<H2>B. Possible reasons and remedies</H2>

<H3>1. Not enough power on the bus</H3>

FHZ1300PC directly connected to the computer's built-in USB ports does not work
at all or seizes to work after short time. This is likely due to the USB's
inability to provide sufficient power to the connected
devices. Use of a powered hub seems to cure the problem in some cases
(confirmed, see [6]).


<H3>2. Mixture of USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 devices</H3>

Use of an USB 1.1 hub to connect USB 2.0 devices and vice versa might lead to
timing problems (see [3]). Consistent use of either USB 1.1 or USB 2.0 devices
might be a cure (unconfirmed).


<H3>3. Timing problems</H3>

It was suggested that late answers from a device make the driver think that it
has gone away. This would lead to a disconnect. followed by a reconnect when
the device's reply arrives. Changing the timeouts
might be a cure. It is not known how to achieve this (see [5]).


<H3>4. Electromagnetic interferences</H3>

EMI appears to be a large issue with FHZ1x00 (for one thing, there are MANY reports
of people mysteriously unable to pair some FHT80b, despite trying very hard).

For many details, see <a href="#emi">Electro-magnetic interference</a> below.

<H3>5. USB Power management</H3>

The linux kernel USB driver supports power management. If there is no activity
on the USB for a certain time, the port is switched to powersaving which leads
to a disconnect of the device (see [3]). Details on
linux power management are found in [4]. In short, you can turn off power
management in general if you do

<pre>
echo -1 >/sys/module/usbcore/parameters/autosuspend
</pre>

or, for a specific device,

<pre>
echo on > Â /sys/bus/usb/devices/DEVICEID/power/level
</pre>

with DEVICEID substituted by the device's ID.

<H3>6. USB extenders</H3>

To increase the maximum cable length from 5 meters to 10 meters, so-called
USB extenders are on sale. They consist of a fixed passive 1-port hub at the end of
an USB cable. This drives the USB to its limits and may cause all sorts of
problems on the bus. Either do not use USB extenders (confirmed, see [10]) at all
or put an active (self-powered) hub in the middle (unconfirmed).

<H1>Electro-magnetic interference (EMI) compendium</H1>

Bad shielding of cables or devices might lead to interferences with electric
devices nearby (fridges, light switches, fluorescent lamps, ...).
A computer can cope with this problem better or worse.
Changing the computer's hardware helps (confirmed, see [7]).
If this is not feasible, use a ferrite ring (see [8] for instance)
or two around the ends of the FHZ cable (semi-confirmed).
(or on other interference-inducing cables!)

Confirmed, AndiM: MANY issues with interference on FHZ1300PC,
which can be observed via drastically increased receiver LED activity
e.g. when a nearby (1m) PC is running - despite some countermeasures.<br>

Symptoms of trouble with interference:<br>
<ul>
 <li>Almost no successful bi-di communication (almost never <code>ack:</code>s received when sending values),
     (re-)pairing FHT80b units was pretty much impossible, too,
     but many <code>can-rcv: 50</code> from several FHTs received while pairing was not successful
     (hmm, perhaps this is a special ID for indication of pairing protocol issues,
     since it's exactly half of FHTID 100??)</li>
 <li>FS20 button reception does work directly after an <code>initFS20</code> or <code>rereadcfg</code> or other
     reset command is executed, but as soon as the first other LED activity
     (interference? FHT traffic?) happens, any FS20 reception whatsoever drops dead again.
     And this specifically affects FS20 handling in FHZ1300PC,
     since specifically <code>initFS20</code> does correct it (IIRC <code>initHMS</code> doesn't)
     and (some parts of) FHT protocol reception still does work in the meantime.</li>
</ul>

Swapping the 1m USB cable with a 1.5m cable (but not overly long - this is said to be problematic as well!)
and adding a ferrite ring (currently at the FHZ1300PC-side cable end) did do wonders,
it completely eliminated all problems (although not sure yet which of these measures contributed by how much,
the increase of the distance from interference-causing parts or the ferrite ring).

Please also note that it is recommended to keep an FHT at least 1.5m from a FHZ, otherwise <a href="http://www.razyboard.com/system/morethread-anmeldung-fht80b-funktioniert-nicht-haforum-53111-2713680-0.html">people experienced pairing problems</a>.

<H1> Misc. issues / hints </H1>

<ul>
<li>Make sure to have correct (and also unique, BTW) FHT codes, otherwise FHZ buffers may fill up due to trying to communicate with an unavailable FHT code
(<a href="http://www.razyboard.com/system/morethread-kommunikation-fhz1000pc-zum-fht80b-haforum-53111-1988993-0.html">Kommunikation FHZ1000PC zum FHT80b</a>).</li>
