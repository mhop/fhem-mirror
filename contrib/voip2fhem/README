****** VoIP2FHEM or HOWTO control the FHEM with Asterisk ******

Description
    * This is a HOWTO about the use of a VoIP-DECT-Telephone as a remote
      controller for the FHEM-Devices.
      The provided scripts are under the GPL.

      The Goal is
      -- Switching the FS20-Devices
      -- text2speach, the Telephone reads e.g. the measured-temp
      -- Possibility to start scripts with the Remote Telephone
      -- AND EVERYTHING MUST RUN ON THE NSLU2 :-)

Technical Overview
    * On the NLSU2 (or every other Linux Box) runs an Asterisk. This machine
      must not be the machine with the FHEM. I bought the Voip-DECT-Telephone
      Siemens Gigaset C470 IP (80.-EUR). It has a nice Webinterface and it is
      possible to read in a self made telephone book.
      The Asterisk calls depending on the dialed number a bash skript. After
      that Asterisk plays two soundfiles < text >< value > in a loop.

      The NSLU2 is a weak machine. It always only creates a soundfile 1x and
      then stores it on the harddisk. A set of prebuild voices (e.g. digits
      from -20 to 90) are included. Some scripts for creating soundfiles and
      automatically the telephone book are provided too.
Installation
    * Go to http://fhem.dnsalias.net/voip2fhem and download the files.
      -- Install with your package manager asterisk, sox, espeak. On the NLSU2:
      "apt-get install asterisk sox espeak".
      -- Debian: activate asterisk in the /etc/default/asterisk
      -- copy the scripts voip2fhem voip2fhem_create_telefonlist
      voip2fhem_create_txt2gsm to /usr/local/bin/ and be shure that they are
      executable (chmod +x /usr/local/bin/voip2fhem*)
      -- You can find on http://fhem.dnsalias.net/voip2fhem prepared voices:
      "tar -xvzf voip2fhem_voices.tar.gz -C /" and give the correct rights
      "chown -R asterisk.asterisk /var/tmp/voip2fhem"
      -- cp extensions.conf and sip.conf to /etc/asterisk/ and edit these files
      and the bash script /usr/local/bin/voip2fhem
      -- restart/reload asterisk (/etc/init.d/asterisk restart or asterisk -
      r and then "extensions reload" and "sip reload")
Hints
    * -- if there isn't the required soundfile then the NSLU2 creates it. This
      needs minutes (example: the word "asterisk" needs 3 min). voip2fhem
      stores this file and the next time it will be used.
      -- Use the script voip2fhem_create_txt2gsm on a faster machine to create
      the sounds. Usage: voip2fhem_create_txt2gsm "I love FHEM". The soundfile
      is then automatically copied to /var/tmp/voip2fhem/
      -- it is also possible to connect the ASTERISK with the rest of the world
      (e.g. Sipgate, 1und1) :-)
      -- for debug asterisk: "asterisk -r", "sip debug"


Have fun and success :-)
