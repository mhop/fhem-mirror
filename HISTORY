- Rudi, Thu Feb  1 13:27:15 MET 2007
  Created the file HISTORY and the file README.DEV

- Pest, Thu Feb  1 20:45 MET 2007
  Added description for attribute ,

- Rudi, Sun Feb 11 18:56:05 MET 2007
  - showtime added for pgm2 (useful for FS20 piri display)
  - defattr command added, it makes easier to assign room, type, etc for a group
    of devices.
  - em1010.pl added to the contrib directory. It seems that we are able
    to read out the EM1010PC. Not verified with multiple devices.

- Pest, Thu Feb 11 23:35 MET 2007
  - Added doc/linux.html (multiple USDB devices, udev links)
  - Linked fhem.html and commandref.html to linux.html

- Martin Haas, Fri Feb 23 10:18 MET 2007
  - ARM-Section (NSLU2) added to doc/linux.html

- Pest, Sat Feb 24 18:30 MET 2007
  - doc/linux.html: Module build re-written.

- Rudi, Sun Mar  4 11:18:10 MET 2007
  Reorganization. Goal: making attribute adding/deleting more uniform
  (,
  possible (i.e. saving the configfile, list of possible devices etc).

  Internal changes:
  - %logmods,%devmods moved to %modules. Makes things more uniform
  - %logs merged into %defs
  - local state info (%readings) changed to global ($defs{$d}{READINGS})
    -> No need for the listfn function in each module
    -> User written scripts can more easily analyze device states

  User visible changes:
  - at/notify ,
    modules. Now it is possible
    - to have a further ,
      (notify & filelog use the same interface)
    - to have more than one notify for the same event
    - to delete at commands without strange escapes.
      The delete syntax changed (no more def/at/ntfy needed)
    - at/notify can have attributes
    Drawback: each at and notify must have a name, which is strange first.
  - logfile/modpath/pidfile/port/verbose ,
    Dumping and extending these attributes is easier, no special handling
    required in the web-frontend.
  - savefile renamed to ,
  - configfile global attribute added.
  - save command added, it writes the statefile and then the configfile.
  - delattr added to delete single attributes
  - list/xmllist format changed, they contain more information.
  - ,
    in the same format. This data is contained in the xmllist.
  - disable attribute for at/notify/filelog
  - rename added

- Rudi, Tue Mar 27 20:43:15 MEST 2007
  fhemweb.pl (webpgm2) changes:
  - adopted to the new syntax
  - better commandline support (return <pre> formatted)
  - FileLog attribute logtype added, and 4 logtypes (== gnuplot files)
    defined: fs20, fht, ks300_1, ks300_2
  - links in the commandref.html file added
  - device dependent attribute and set support

- Pest, Sun Apr 08 17:55:15 MEST 2007
  em1010.pl:
  - Make difference between sensors 1..4 and 5..
  - Checked values for sensor 5 (cur.energy + cur.power) - ok
  - Checked values for sensor 5 cur.energy is ok, cur.power still off.
    Correction factor needs to be determined.
  - setTime: Without argument, now the current time of the PC is used.
  - setRperKW: Factor of 10 required, 75 U/kWh -> 750.

- Pest, Tue Apr 10 20:31:22 MEST 2007
  em1010.pl:

    delattr
  - defattr renamed to setdefaultattr (same as before for def)
  - devicespec introduced:
    it may contain a list of devices, a range of devices, or multiple devices
    identified by regexp. Following commands take a devicespec as argument:
    attr, deleteattr, delete, get, list, set, setstate, trigger

- Boris Sat Dec 29 16:56:00 CET 2007
  - %NAME, %EVENT, %TYPE parameters in notify definition, commandref.html update

    update

- Rudi Mon Dec 31 15:37:19 MET 2007
  - feature: webfrontend/pgm2 converted to a FHEM module
    No more need for a webserver for basic WEB administration. For HTTPS or
    password you still need apache or the like.
    One step closer for complete fhem on the FritzBox.

- Boris Sun Jan 06 13:35:00 CET 2008
  - bugfix: 62_EMEM.pm:  changed reading energy_total_kWh to energy_kWh_w,
    added energy_kWh (formerly energy_total_kWh)
  - changed em1010.pl accordingly, added em1000em doc for getDevStatus reply
    from device
  - minor changes in fhem.html

- Rudi Tue Jan  8 21:13:08 MET 2008
  - feature: attr global allowfrom <ip-adresses/hostnames>
    If set, only connects from these addresses are allowed. This is to
    "simulate" a little bit of security.

- Rudi Sat Jan 19 18:04:12 MET 2008
  - FHT: multiple commands
    Up to 8 commands in one set, these are transmitted at once to the FHT
  - softbuffer changes
    minfhtbuffer attribute, as otherwise nearly everything will be sent to
    the FHT buffer, so ordering won't take effect.
  - cmd rename
    report1,report2. refreshvalues changed to report1 and report2. refreshvalues
    won't be advertized but still replaced with "report1 255 report2 255"
  - extensive documentation update for the FHT
  - lime-protection changed, as it is an actuator subcommand. Further actuator
    commands added.

- Rudi Sun Jan 27 18:12:42 MET 2008
  - em1010PC: sending a "67" after a reset skips the manual interaction:
    automatic reset is now possible.

- Peter S. Sat Feb 16 22:22:21 MET 2008
  - linux.html: Note on kernel 2.6.24.2 (includes our changes)

- Peter S. Wed Mar 19 08:24:00 MET 2008
  - 00_FHZ.pm: DoTriger -> DoTrigger

- Rudi Fri May  9 20:00:00 MEST 2008
  - feature: FHEM modules may live on a filesystem with "ignorant" casing (FAT)
    If you install FHEM on a USB-Stick (e.g. for the FritzBox) it may happen
    that the filename casing is different from the function names inside the
    file.
    -> Fhem won't find the <module>_Initialize function. Fixed by searching all
    function-names for a match with "ignore-case"
  - feature: FileLog function "set reopen" impemented. In case you want to
    delete some wrong entries from a current logfile, you must tell fhem to
    reopen the file again
  - feature: multiline commands are supported through the command line
    Up till now multiline commands were supported only by "include". Now they
    are supprted from the (tcp/ip) connection too, so they can be used by the
    web frontends.
  - feature: pgm2 installation changes, multiple instances, external css
    pgm2 (FHEMWEB) is now a "real" fhem module:
    - the configuration takes place via attributes
    - the css file is external, and each FHEMWEB instance can use its own set
    - the default location for pictures, gnuplot scripts and css is the FHEM
      module directory
    - multiline support for notify and at scripts.
    - feature: FileLog "set reopen" for manual tweaking of logfiles.
    - feature: multiline commands are supported through the command line
    - feature: pgm2 installation changes, multiple instances, external css

-tdressler Sa May  10 23:00:00 MEST 2008
  - feature:add WS2000 Support new modul 87_ws2000.pm and standalone
           reader/server ws2000_reader.pl
  - doc: modified fhem.html/commandref.html reflectiing ws2000 device and
    added windows support (tagged:before tdressler_20080510_1, after
    tdressler_20080510_2)

-tdressler So May 11 19:30:00 MEST 2008
  - feature: add ReadyFn to fhem.pl in main loop to have an alternative for
    select, which is not working on windows (thomas 11.05)

    ReadyFn
  - bugfix : FileLog: dont use FH->sync on windows (not implemented there)
  - feature: EM, WS300, FHZ:Add Switch for Device::SerialPort and
    Win32::SerialPort to get it running in Windows (sorry, untestet)

 -tdressler So May 11 23:30:00 MEST 2008
  - bugfix:  FileLog undefined $data in FileLog_Get
  - feature: fhem.pl check modules for compiletime errors and do not initialize
    them if any

- Peter S. Mon Jun 02 00:39 MET 2008
  - linux.html: openSUSE 11 contains our changes.

- Thu Jun 12 07:15:03 MEST 2008
  - feature: FileLog get to read logfiles / webpgm2: gnuplot-scroll mode to
    navigate/zoom in logfiles
    webpgm2 uses the FileLog get to grep data for a given data range from a
    logfile. Using this grep scrolling to a different date range / zooming
    to another resolution (day/week/month/year) can be implemented.
    The logfiles should be large, as scrolling across logfiles is not
    implemented. To speed up the grep, a binary search with seek is used, and
    seek positions are cached.

- Thu Jul 11 07:15:03 MEST 2008
  - feature: 99_SVG.pm for webpgm2: generates SVG from the logfile.
    Generating SVG is configurable, the "old" gnuplot mode is still there.
    Downside of the SVG: the browser must support SVG (Firefox/Opera does,
    I.E. with the Adobe plugin), and the browsesr consumes more memory.
    Upside: no gnuplot needed on the server, faster(?), less data to transfer
    for daily data.
    Tested with Firefox 3.0.
    Todo: Test with IE+Adobe Plugin/Opera.
  - feature: HOWTO for webpgm2 (first chapter)

- Fri Jul 25 18:14:26 MEST 2008
  - Autoloading modules. In order to make module installation easier and
    to optimize memory usage, modules are loaded when the first device of a
    certain category is defined. Exceptions are the modules prefixed with 99,
    these are considered "utility" modules and are loaded at the beginning.
    Some of the older 99_x modules were renamed (99_SVG, 99_dummy), and most
    contrib modules were moved to the main FHEM directory.

- Boris Sat Nov 01 CET 2008
  - feature: new commands fullinit and reopen for FHZ, commandref.html update

- Sat Nov 15 10:23:56 MET 2008 (Rudi)
  - Watchdog crash fixed: watchdog could insert itself more than once in the
    internal timer queue. The first one deletes all occurances from the list,
    but the loop over the list works on the cached keys -> the function/arg for
    the second key is already removed.
  - feature: X10 support for pgm3

- Boris Sat Nov 15 CET 2008
  - bugfix: correct correction factors for EMEM in 15_CUL_EM.pm

- Wed Dec  3 18:36:56 MET 2008 (Rudi)
  - reorder commandref.html, so that all aspects of a device
    (define/set/get/attributes) are in one block. This makes possible to
    "outsource" device documentation
  - added "mobile" flag to the CUL definition, intended for a CUR, which is
    a remote with a battery, so it is not connected all the time to fhem.
    Without the flag fhem will block when the CUR is disconnected.
    Note: we have to sleep after disconnect for 5 seconds, else the Linux
    kernel sends us a SIGSEGV, and the USB device is gone till the next reboot.
  - the fhem CUL part documented

- Sun Dec  7 21:09 (Boris)
  - reworked 15_CUL_EM.pm to account for timer wraparounds, more readings added
  - speed gain through disabled refreshvalues query to all FHTs at definition;
    if you want it back at a "set myFHT report1 255 report2 255" command to the
    config file.

- Mon Dec  8 21:26 MET 2008 (Rudi)
  - Modules can now modify the cmds hash, i.e. modules can add / overwrite /
    delete internal fhem commands. See 99_XmlList.pm for an example. Since this
    modules is called 99_xxx, it will be always loaded, but user of webpgm2 do
    not need it.

- Wed Dec 17 19:48 (Boris)
  - attribute rainadjustment for KS300 in 13_KS300.pm to account for random
    switches in the rain counter (see commandref.html)

- Fri Jan  2 10:29 2009 (Rudi)
  - 00_CUL responds to CUR request. These are sent as long FS20 messages, with
    a housecode stored in CUR_id_list attribute of the CUL device. If the ID
    matches, the message is analyzed, and an FS20 message to the same address
    is sent back. The CUR must have reception enabled.
    Right now status/set time/set FHT desired temp are implemented.

- Fri Jan  6 (Boris)
  - daily/monthly cumulated values for EMWZ/EMGZ/EMWM with 15_CUL_EM by Klaus

- Sun Jan 11 (Klaus)
  - Added fixedrange option day|week|month|year (for pgm2)
    e.g.: attr wlEnergiemonat fixedrange month
  - Added multiple room assignments for one device (for pgm2):
    e.g.: attr Heizvorlauftemp room Energie,Heizung
  - Added attr title and label(s) for more flexible .gplot files (for pgm2)
    e.g.: attr wl_KF title "Fenster:".$value{KellerFenster}.", Entfeuchter: ".$value{Entfeuchter}
          .gplot: <TL> (is almost there!)
          attr wl_KF label "Fenster":"Entfeuchter"
          .gplot: <L0> ... <L9> (constant text is to be replaced individually)
  - Added attr global logdir, used by wildcard %ld in perl.pm
    e.g.: attr global logdir /var/tmp
          define emGaslog FileLog %ld/emGas.log emGas:.*CNT.*
