- 2006-08-13 (2.5)
  Special thanks to STefan Mayer for a lot of suggestions and bug reports
  - If a command is enclosed in {}, then it will be evaluated as a perl
    expression, if it is enclosed in "" then it is a shell command, else it is
    a "normal" fhz1000 command.
    "at" and "notifyon" follow this convention too.
    Note: a shell command will always be issued in the background.
  - won't die anymore if the at spec contains an unknown command
  - rereadcfg added. Sending a HUP should work better now
  - escaping % and @ in the notify argument is now possible with %% or @@
  - new command trigger to test notify commands
  - where you could specify an fhz command, now you can specify a list of
    them, separated by ";". Escape is ;;
  - KS300 sometimes reports "negative" rain when it begins to rain.  Filter
    such values. israining is set when the raincounter changed or the ks300
    israining bit is set.
  - sleep command, with millisecond accuracy
  - HMS 100MG support by Peter Stark.
  - Making FHT and FS20 messages more uniform
  - contrib/fs20_holidays.sh by STefan Mayer
    (simulate presence while on holiday)
  - webfrontends/pgm4 by STefan Mayer: fs20.php
  - KS300 avg. monthly values fixed (hopefully)
  - deleted undocumented "exec" function (you can write it now as {...})

- 2006-07-23 (2.4)
  - contrib/four2hex (to convert between ELV and our codes) by Peter Stark
  - make dist added to set version (it won't work in a released version)
  - reload function to reload (private) perl modules
  - 20_FHT.pm fix: undef occures once without old data
  - "setstate comment" is replaced with the attr command (i.e. attribute).
    The corresponding xmllist COMMENT tag is replaced with the ATTR tag.
    Devices or logs can have attr definitions.
  - webfrontend/pgm2 (fhzweb.pl) updated to handle "room" attributes(showing
    only devices in this room).
  - version 0.4.2 of webfrontend/pgm3 integrated.
  - contrib/ks300avg.pl to compute daily and monthly avarage values.
  - the 40_KS300.pm module is computing daily and monthly avarages for the
    temp/hum and wind values and sum of the rain. The cum_day and cum_month
    state variables are used as helper values.  To log the avarage use the
    .*avg.* regexp. The regexp for the intraday log will trigger it also.
  - Added the contrib file garden.pl as a more complex example: garden
    irrigation. The program computes the time for irrigation from the avarage
    temperature reported by the ks300-2.
  - Enable uppercase hex codes (Bug reported by STefan Mayer)
  - Renamed the unknown_XX FHT80b codes to code_XXXXXX, this will produce
    "Undefined type" messages when reading the old save file
  - RM100-2 added (thanks for the codes from andikt).

- 2006-6-22 (2.3)
  - CRC checking (i.e. ignoring messages with bad CRC, message on verbose 4)
  - contrib/checkmesg.pl added to check message consistency (debugging)
  - FHT: unknown_aa, unknown_ba codes added. What they are for?
  - Empty modpath / no modpath error messages added (some user think modpath is
    superfluous)
  - Unparsed messages (verbose 5) now printed as hex
  - Try to reattach to the usb device if it disappears: no need to
    restart the server if the device is pulled out from the USB socket and
    plugged in again (old versions go into a busy loop here).
  - Supressing the seldom (ca 1 out of 700) short KS300 messages.
    (not sure how to interpret them)
  - Added KS300 "israining" status flag. Note: this not always triggers when it
    is raining, but there seems to be a correlation. To be evaluated in more
    detail.
  - notifyon can now execute "private" perl code as well (updated
    commandref.html, added the file example/99_PRIV.pm)
  - another "perl code" example is logging the data into the database
    (with DBI), see the file contrib/91_DbLog.pm. Tested with an Oracle DB.
